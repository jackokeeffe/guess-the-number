# guess-the-number
A short program which lets the user guess a number between 1-100 that was randomly generated using the random module in Python.

## Guess the Number How-To:
1. Copy code into any IDE supporting Python.
2. Run code, this will than give you options (through input statements) where you will enter your number.
- When answering the input questions, entering a number must be answered as an integer (1, 10, 15, etc.).
- When the question contains (y/n), answer using y or n. y = Yes, n = No.
